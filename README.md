# molu ðŸ‘§

The mail provider in the Skedulr stack. It is currently built to work with Google Mail. But, by implementing the required communication APIs, more providers can be added into the `molu` group.

## Running It

1. Install the requirements by running

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Get a `client-secret.json` file from the Google Console with access to the Gmail API. Name this file `credentials.json` in the project directory.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
